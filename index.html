                  <h2>What is Affogato?</h2>
                  <p>An affogato, translating into English as "drowned", consists of a scoop of ice cream placed in an espresso cup with a shot of espresso poured over the top, which melts the ice cream slightly--a decadent drink often served in Italy as a dessert. The firm ice cream is eaten with a spoon, and the melted ice cream and espresso are sipped.</p>

                  <h2>Making the Affogato</h2>
                      <h3>Machine Espresso</h3>
                          <p>Espresso coffee is one of the most popular coffee extraction methods and there are numerous machines that can be used to extract an espress shot. The quantities and timings recommended by coffee professionals differ significantly according to the type of roast, bean, style, and individual taste. As a guide, the weights and measures given below are provided by coffee roasters Climpson & Sons of London, England, as a result of their extensive trials and tests, and are those used in their barista training classes</p>

          <h2>Method</h2>
              <ul class="list-style">
                  <li>1 Let water run through the machine without the grouphead to flush out any old coffee grounds.</li>
                  <li>2 Grind the coffee beans to fine using the burr grinder; then remove the portafilter basket from the grouphead. Using the scale, measure out the coffee grounds into the basket, being sure that the weight is within the range specified above.</li>
                <li><img src="image1.png" class="img" alt="im1"/></li>
                  <li>3 Level out the coffee grounds so that they are evenly distributed. As water will follow the path of least resistance, if your grounds are distributed unevenly, the water will flow through the least compacted side, leading some of the grounds to overextract and some to underextract.</li>
                  <li>4 Click the basket back into the grouphead and then, resting the grouphead on the mat, use the tamper to press the grounds down.
                   <li><img src="image2.png" class="img" alt="im1"/></li>
                  <li>5 Put the grouphead into the espresso machine, making sure it is pulled tight.</li>
                <li><img src="image3.png" class="img" alt="im1"/></li>
                <li>6 Add a scoop or two of icecream in your coffee cup.</li>
                <li><img src="image4.png" class="img" alt="im1"/></li>
                  <li>7 Place the cup on the kichen scale underneath the grouphead. Tare or set the scale to zero.</li>
                  <li>8 Press the button to strat extraction and at the same time press start on the timer.</li>
                  <li>9 Wait for the coffee to extract, keeping an eye on the weight and time. The extracted weight should be 26 to 30 grams within the 25- to 30-second time frame, you will need to grind the beans finer to slow down extraction. If the weight is less than 26 grams in the 25- to 30-second time frame, the grind needs to be coarser to speed up extraction and prevent overextraction. Serve immediately.</li>
